# One Button Boss

## What Is This Game?

One Button Boss is a pixel-art bullet hell game where you face off against a single, relentless boss that grows deadlier with every defeat. Dodge waves of projectiles, graze bullets for bonus points, and dash through the boss to deal damage — all wrapped in a retro arcade aesthetic with CRT scanlines and synthesized audio.

## How to Play

### Controls

| Input | Action |
|-------|--------|
| **WASD** | Move in four directions |
| **Mouse** | Move toward cursor position |
| **Space** | Dash (grants brief invincibility) |

### Core Mechanics

- **Dash Attack**: Dash through the boss to deal damage. This is your only way to hurt it.
- **Graze**: Skim past bullets without getting hit to earn bonus points and charge your score multiplier. The closer you fly, the higher the reward.
- **Slow Motion**: Near-miss moments trigger a brief slow-motion effect, giving you a split second to react.

### Boss Phases

The boss shifts through three phases as its health drops:

1. **Phase 1** (Health > 70%) — Predictable fan shots and circular bursts. Learn the patterns here.
2. **Phase 2** (Health 30-70%) — Rotating barrages, explosive bullets, and homing projectiles join the fight.
3. **Phase 3** (Health < 30%) — Full bullet hell. Cross barrages from screen edges, fake-out bullets, warning zone attacks, and spiral storms.

### Upgrades

Each time you defeat the boss, pick one of four upgrades before the next round begins:

| Upgrade | Effect |
|---------|--------|
| **DASH SPD** | Reduce dash cooldown by 20% |
| **DASH DST** | Increase dash distance by 30% |
| **GRAZE X2** | Double your graze score multiplier |
| **LIFE STEAL** | Heal when you hit the boss with a dash |

### Scoring

| Action | Points |
|--------|--------|
| Dash Attack (hit boss) | +100 |
| Graze (per bullet) | +10 |
| Boss Defeat | +5,000 |

### Progression

After each boss defeat, the boss respawns stronger — more health, faster attacks, quicker movement. Stack your upgrades wisely and see how many waves you can survive.

## Tips

- Dashing makes you invincible. Use it to dodge through dense bullet patterns, not just to attack.
- Graze aggressively in Phase 1 while the patterns are forgiving — build your score early.
- Save your dash for emergencies in Phase 3. The cooldown matters.
- Life Steal can carry a run if you play aggressively enough.
